# 20231129 - Project Update: Migration to ECMAScript 6 Modules.

We have recently migrated our project's module system from CommonJS to ECMAScript 6 (ESM). This change aligns our codebase with modern JavaScript standards and brings several advantages to the development and maintainability of our project.

## Key Changes:

- **Import Statements:**
  - **CommonJS (before):**
    ```javascript
    const module = require('module');
    ```

  - **ECMAScript 6 (after):**
    ```javascript
    import module from 'module';
    ```

- **Export Statements:**
  - **CommonJS (before):**
    ```javascript
    module.exports = someFunction;
    ```

  - **ECMAScript 6 (after):**
    ```javascript
    export default someFunction;
    ```

## Advantages of ECMAScript 6 Modules:

1. **Standardization:**
   ESM is the standardized module system for JavaScript, providing consistency across different environments and tools.

2. **Static Analysis:**
   ESM allows for static analysis of imports, leading to better tooling support and potential optimizations during the build process.

3. **Named Exports:**
   ESM supports named exports, allowing for cleaner and more explicit organization of exported values.

4. **Tree Shaking:**
   ESM supports tree shaking, reducing bundle sizes by eliminating unused exports during the build process.

5. **Consistency:**
   Using ESM aligns our codebase with modern JavaScript practices and prepares it for future language features.

We believe that this migration enhances the development experience and sets the stage for a more maintainable and scalable project. If you have any questions or concerns about this change, feel free to reach out!
